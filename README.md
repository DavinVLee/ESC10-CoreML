## ECS-10-CoreML

A CoreML sound classification model based on the ECS-10 Dataset


### CreateML Project And Dataset
The CreateML project file used to create the ESC-10-CoreML-Demo, as well as the ESC-10 dataset, is included.
The dataset is split into a `testing-data` set and a `training-data` set. The `CreateML Project Test Audio Files`
folder contains additional test CC-NonAttribution sound files downloaded from freesound.org.


### Demo App
A demo iOS app is included in `ESC-10-CoreML-Demo`. It includes ten pre-loaded .wav audio files
that the are analyzed using the `SoundAnalysis` framework and the `ESC-10 Sound Classifier.mlmodel`.
